This repository hosts Joal's [Helm](https://helm.sh) charts.
Chart documentation is automatically generated using [helm-docs](https://github.com/norwoodj/helm-docs).

The source of this chart is based on the excellent work done by [`anthonyraymond/joal`](https://github.com/anthonyraymond/joal)

## Kubernetes version support

We test the four latest versions of Kubernetes.
The general concept is that we track the versions of Kubernetes that are supported by the major cloud providers.

- [Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS)](https://endoflife.date/amazon-eks)
- [Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](https://endoflife.date/azure-kubernetes-service)
- [Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)](https://endoflife.date/google-kubernetes-engine)
